### What is ADC ? 

An ADC (Application Delivery Controller) is a sophisticated server load balancer. It directs traffic to available destination servers based on health checks and load-balancing algorithms. A comprehensive ADC, such as the FortiADC, enhances application performance by offloading certain server tasks. These tasks include SSL encryption/decryption, Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection, Gzip compression, and routing processes like Network Address Translation (NAT).

FortiADC utilizes Layer 4 and Layer 7 session information to enable an ADC policy and management framework for:

- Server load balancing
- Link load balancing
- Global load balancing
- Security

The FortiADC family comprises both physical and virtual appliances. More details on different platforms can be found here.
