### Review Threat Analytics Dashboard

Fortinet AI Threat Analytics utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and correlate attack patterns across the entire application attack surface, consolidating them into actionable security incidents. By distinguishing high-priority threats from low-value alerts and false positives, it helps security teams focus on the most critical risks.

The system analyzes FortiADC attack logs in real time, aggregating events based on shared attributes and organizing them into incidents. This enables visibility into recurring attack trends, such as the most frequent attack types or the most aggressive source IP addresses.

Users can drill down into specific incidents by selecting the incident ID to view comprehensive details, including attack type, targeted application, and associated source IPs.
